Here are some useful Mac apps I recommended! Continually updated.
<!--more-->

**It is recommended to use [ Homebrew ](https://brew.sh) to install and manage your applications( e.g. `brew install vim`)**

> My application selection criteria ( the importance decreases in order ):
>
> 1. Open source application ( can be a paid app )
> 2. Long-term maintenance by developers
> 3. Only one application with the same function
> 4. Simple and beautiful
